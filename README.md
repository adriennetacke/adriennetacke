I'm a Filipina software engineer based in ðŸŒµ Las Vegas.

Currently, I'm a Senior Developer Advocate for MongoDB!

You may find yourself here because you've heard me [speak at a conference](https://blog.adrienne.io/speaking/), read my book [Coding for Kids: Python](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Kids-Python-Awesome-Activities/dp/1641521759), or have taken one of my LinkedIn Learning courses (maybe [this one](https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/AzureEssentialTraining) or [that one](https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/OdxAP)?)

Ultimately, what I want you to know most about me is that I love solving complex problems and building awesome things. Particularly with C# or JavaScript. Then, I talk about it and create resources for other devs to do the same. Most of those resources end up here!

Thank you for stopping by!
